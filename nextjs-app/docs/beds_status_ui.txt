Bed Status UI – Development Plan

Main Goals:
1. Show a list or table of all beds.
2. Display today's status schedule for each bed (the view implicitly resets daily).
3. Allow multiple statuses per bed per day (schedule-like behavior).
4. Provide a way to add a status to a bed:
   • Prompt for start time (default = now).
   • Prompt for duration via dropdown (15-minute increments, 15 min → 10 h).
   • Prompt for free-text status description.
5. Persist new statuses to the database and update the UI immediately.
6. In the overview, clearly indicate:
   • Duration of each status block.
   • Whether the status is currently active.
   • Time remaining until the next status or until the bed becomes free.
7. Enable editing of existing status entries.
8. Prevent overlapping statuses on add/edit and display a clear error message if overlap is detected.
9. Support deleting a status (e.g., click the status block to open an edit/delete modal).

UI Ideas:
• Grid layout: 2-3 rows with ~10 beds per row.
• Each bed is rendered as a block (similar to a Google Calendar or school schedule cell).
• Within each bed block, individual statuses are shown as sub-blocks spanning their time ranges.
