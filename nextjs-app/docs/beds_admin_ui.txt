Revised User-Interface Design Document
Admin – “Beds” Management Page (simplified)
Purpose & Audience
Purpose: Let administrators quickly Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) and reorder “Bed” records in the beds table.
Audience: Internal staff working mainly on desktop screens.
Entry & Navigation
Navigation item: “Admin” → “Beds”.
Page Title: “Beds Management”.
Page Layout (Desktop)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header: page title on left • “Add Bed” primary button on right│
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Beds Table (drag-sortable list) │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Core UI Components & Behaviour
4.1 Add Bed
“Add Bed” button opens a modal with a single “Name” input.
Buttons: “Save” (primary) and “Cancel”.
Validation: name is required and unique (checked on blur or on save).
On success: close modal, show toast “Bed added”, insert new row at the bottom (or appropriate order).
4.2 Beds Table
Columns:
Drag Handle – used to reorder rows by dragging.
Name
Actions – “Edit” (pencil) and “Delete” (trash).
Interactions:
Drag-and-drop rows to change order. Dropping a row sends a PATCH to /beds/reorder; on success, toast “Order saved”.
Clicking “Edit” opens the same modal pre-filled with the bed name. “Save” updates the row immediately.
Clicking “Delete” opens a confirmation dialog; “Delete” permanently removes the row and shows toast “Bed deleted”.
Empty state: simple message “No beds yet” with an “Add Bed” button.
4.3 Modals & Dialogs
Add / Edit modal width ~420 px, vertical center.
Delete confirmation dialog: title “Delete bed ‘{name}’?”, body text “This cannot be undone.”, buttons “Cancel” (secondary) and “Delete” (destructive).
Visual & Interaction Details
Use existing design-system tokens for spacing, typography, colors.
Primary buttons (green), secondary buttons (gray), destructive buttons (red).
Table rows change background color on hover for clarity.
Toast notifications appear bottom-right and auto-dismiss after 4 s.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Optimistic UI updates so the list feels instant (<200 ms perceived).
Security: Only users with admin role can access /admin/beds route.
Internationalization: Labels pulled from existing message files (en, th).
Testing: Playwright end-to-end tests covering add, edit, delete, reorder scenarios.
Out-of-Scope Elements (explicitly excluded)
✗ Search or filters
✗ Pagination
✗ Dedicated accessibility accommodations
✗ Mobile-specific layouts (page optimized for desktop use only)
This streamlined plan focuses purely on CRUD and drag-reorder, keeping the interface minimal and fast for administrators.
