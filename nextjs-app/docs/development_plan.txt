This document is intended as instructions to the AI agent.
This is a development plan for how to build this next.js webapp.

Ground rules:
We are doing TDD (test driven development), tests firsts etc.
We are writing e2e tests in playwright.
We do not modify package.json directly when installing packages, we use npm install etc.
The project is using typescript.
Sometimes you the AI agent cannot fix issues by running commands locally but must instead 
instruct me the user to go to vercel or supabase to set things up there.

Deployment:
The app is deployed to vercel. but we develop locally.

Database: 
we will use supabase that vercel created for us.
and we will use prisma as intermediary to talk with supabase in a type-safe way.

Auth:
The entire webapp requires is behind a login-wall. 
The auth should be simple login/password.
No connection to other auth providers like google oauth etc. 
See example auth here: https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example
But again, the auth should not use fancy oauth stuff.
We will use supabase auth

Testing:
We are doing TDD and we use playwright to test everything.
