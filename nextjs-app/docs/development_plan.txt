This document is intended as instructions to the AI agent.
This is a development plan for how to build this next.js webapp.

Ground rules:
We are doing TDD (test driven development), tests firsts etc.
We are writing e2e tests in playwright.
We do not modify package.json directly when installing packages, we use npm install etc.
The project is using typescript.
Sometimes you the AI agent cannot fix issues by running commands locally but must instead 
instruct me the user to go to vercel or supabase to set things up there.

Deployment:
The app is deployed to vercel. but we develop locally.

Database: 
we will use supabase that vercel created for us. seems to already work.
and we will use prisma as intermediary to talk with supabase in a type-safe way.

Auth:
We will use supabase auth. seems to already work.

Testing:
We are doing TDD and we use playwright to test everything.

User interface for beds:
Bed, patient reference, start time (default now), length (30 minute increments), free text comment/status
-- ability to change length


TODO:

Add something to the users/auth to indicate if they are admins or regular users.
-- looks like the auth's schema is somewhat protected (it cant be edited by table editor, only sql editor)
-- create a public.users table instead. use email + role columns? 


Figure out how to test CRUD stuff when there's already data?!
Make a plan for a user interface for the configuration page for beds
Write tests for the configuration page
Write code for the configuration page
